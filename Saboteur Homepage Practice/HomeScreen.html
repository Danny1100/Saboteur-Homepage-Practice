                <h2>Rules</h2>
                <p><b><i>Goal:</i></b> Either hold the saboteur once the central card pile is exhausted OR be the last player standing<br><br>
                <b><i>Gameplay:</i></b> Each player starts with two cards that only they can see. The rest of the cards go into a deck in the middle. <br>
                The game starts at one player and goes clockwise around until someone wins.<br>
                At the start of each player's turn, they draw a card and can choose to replace one of their cards with the new one. They must then discard a card.<br>
                After that, they can (but don't have to) use any card ability even of a card they do not own.<br>
                Whenever a player uses a card ability, it can be challenged by any other player. If their ability is challenged, they must show that they own that card. <br>
                If they cannot/choose not to prove they have that ability, they discard a card of their choice and must play with one less card for the rest of the game. <br>
                However, if they are able to show that they own a card with that ability, the person who challenged permanently loses a card instead. <br>
                If a player loses both cards they are eliminated from that game. <br>
                If the card that the player loses is a saboteur, it is shuffled back into the deck instead of being discarded.
